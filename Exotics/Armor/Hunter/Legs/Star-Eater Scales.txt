Hunter Exotic Legs

Update 3.2.0.2 (May 25, 2021)
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50381

	- Increased the maximum number of stacks required for the full damage bonus from four stacks to eight stacks.
	
Update 3.2.0.3 (June 3, 2021)

- Now correctly grants its damage bonus while the player is standing in a Well of Radiance. 
- The status icon for Feast of Light now correctly scales up to x8, gaining one stack per Orb picked up. 
- Fixed an issue when calculating Super bonus damage. Having 4 stacks of Feast of Light will grant a 55% bonus to Super damage, and having a full 8 stacks will grant a 70% bonus to Super damage. For context, the original formula at the start of the Season was a 60% bonus to damage at 4 stacks.
